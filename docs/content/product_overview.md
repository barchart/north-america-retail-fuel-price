# Overview

## Description

Our North American Retail Fuel Price dataset represents the benchmark offering for retail diesel and gasoline prices throughout North America.  On average we provide users of this dataset with live retail prices from over 6,000 major travel centers across North America.

Each price series relates to two key types of data:
* Price Data - This covers daily spot price.  Historical data is available starting in 2019.
* Metadata - This relates to information that describes either the facility or the price series are related to a given facility.  Typically this will cover geo-location, fips codes (area definitions), fuel product description, parking spaces, DEF lanes, scale availability, business hours and more.
